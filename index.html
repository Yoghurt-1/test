    <title>Why I Like Sakurauchi Riko</title>

</head>

<body>
    <h1>Riko Sakurauchi is a great singer. </h1>
    Riko Sakurauchi is also part of the sub-unit, Gulity Kiss, which has to be one of the best subunits ever created by Love Live.
    <p>Her voice is soft, consistent, and legato-like with a romantic, whispery flair. I would give her singing a solid 8/10. </p>

    <p>Here's a cool song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyXhjyW3OFQ">Love Spiral Tower</a></p>
